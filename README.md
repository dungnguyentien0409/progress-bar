# Progress Bar
I am Chris Dung Nguyen

This is the Front End side progress bar implemented by me.
It is reponsive solution, I use vanilla Javascript, HTML/CSS, SCSS.

The data is read from the endpoint: http://pb-api.herokuapp.com/bars

Test by Jasmine framework

I also include the node_modules

To run it, please get all and open the "index.html"
and that's all step

To run the test case, please open the "test/SpecRunner.html"

All test cases are inside "test/spec" to test all js files in "src/scripts"

Implement a responsive solution.

Animate the bar change, make sure it works well when you tap buttons quickly.

Version control (git)
